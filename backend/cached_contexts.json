    "context": "üîí **CyberGuard AI Response**\n\nSecure Authentication Best Practices:\r\n\r\n1. Use Strong Passwords: Always use strong passwords that include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using common words or phrases as your password.\r\n\r\n2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): 2FA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification before you can access them. This could be a code sent via text message, email, or generated through an authentication app.\r\n\r\n3. Use Password Managers: A password manager securely stores all your login information and generates strong passwords for you. It also allows you to easily manage multiple accounts with one master password.\r\n\r\n4. Avoid Public Wi-Fi Networks: Public Wi-Fi networks are often not secure, which makes them vulnerable to hacking attempts. If possible, avoid using public Wi-Fi networks when accessing sensitive information or conducting online transactions.\r\n\r\n5. Keep Your Software Up-to-Date: Always keep your operating system and software up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates. This helps protect against known vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.\r\n\r\n6. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN): A VPN encrypts all your internet traffic, making it difficult for hackers to intercept or steal your data. It also hides your IP address, which can help prevent identity theft and other types of cyber attacks.\r\n\r\n7. Be Cautious with Email Attachments: Always be cautious when opening email attachments from unknown sources. Malicious emails may contain viruses or malware that could harm your computer or steal sensitive information.\r\n\r\n8. Use Antivirus Software: Antivirus software can help protect against malware and other types of cyber threats. It scans your system for known threats and removes them before they can cause any damage.\r\n\r\n9. Avoid Sharing Personal Information Online: Be careful about sharing personal information online, such as you\n\n... [Response truncated for readability]"

Focus on cybersecurity implications if applicable.\n\nContent from OWASP Top Ten Predications for 2025 - TCM Security:\nOWASP Top 10 Prediction | 2025 by TCMS Staff | Jan 29, 2025 | Web Applications | 0 comments Every four years, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) publishes a top ten list of the most critical security risks that web applications are prone to. This list was last published in 2021, marking 2025 as the year for an update. OWASP utilizes a plethora of data from trusted organization vendors, bug bounty programs, and internal data contributed by organizations to determine the list. In this blog, we will take a look at CVE data from 2021 through 2024 to make a rough estimation of what the OWASP top 10 2025 list will look like. Why CVE Data? The data submitted by organizations for the top 10 list has grown significantly each time around, with over 500k applications submitted in the 2021 call for data. Since it is impossible to know the massive data set that OWASP is working from, we will use open-source data such as CVEs to help make our predictions data-driven. CVE data records can be queried from Mitre at https://cveawg.mitre.org/api/cve/ <CVE-ID>. This API data includes a CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) mapping, if applicable, which will drastically help in data analysis. Luckily, the CVEProject Github repository pulls this data from Mitre every hour, so we don‚Äôt have to scrape it through API requests. Data Collection Python was utilized to extract CWE and CVSS base score metrics from the CVE data. Let‚Äôs break down the different components of the code written for data collection and analysis . To start out, a function called ‚Äúget_owasp_2021_cwes‚Äù was defined that returns a dictionary containing the OWASP top 10 2021 mappings with their applicable CWE mappings. This will help us map the 2021-2024 CVE data to 2021‚Äôs OWASP top 10, as many of these categories wil",
