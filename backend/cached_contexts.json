    "context": "🔒 **CyberGuard AI Response**\n\nSecure Authentication Best Practices:\r\n\r\n1. Use Strong Passwords: Always use strong passwords that include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using common words or phrases as your password.\r\n\r\n2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): 2FA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second form of verification before you can access them. This could be a code sent via text message, email, or generated through an authentication app.\r\n\r\n3. Use Password Managers: A password manager securely stores all your login information and generates strong passwords for you. It also allows you to easily manage multiple accounts with one master password.\r\n\r\n4. Avoid Public Wi-Fi Networks: Public Wi-Fi networks are often not secure, which makes them vulnerable to hacking attempts. If possible, avoid using public Wi-Fi networks when accessing sensitive information or conducting online transactions.\r\n\r\n5. Keep Your Software Up-to-Date: Always keep your operating system and software up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates. This helps protect against known vulnerabilities that hackers could exploit.\r\n\r\n6. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN): A VPN encrypts all your internet traffic, making it difficult for hackers to intercept or steal your data. It also hides your IP address, which can help prevent identity theft and other types of cyber attacks.\r\n\r\n7. Be Cautious with Email Attachments: Always be cautious when opening email attachments from unknown sources. Malicious emails may contain viruses or malware that could harm your computer or steal sensitive information.\r\n\r\n8. Use Antivirus Software: Antivirus software can help protect against malware and other types of cyber threats. It scans your system for known threats and removes them before they can cause any damage.\r\n\r\n9. Avoid Sharing Personal Information Online: Be careful about sharing personal information online, such as you\n\n... [Response truncated for readability]"
